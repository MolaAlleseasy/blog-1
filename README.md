# blog

My personal blog.

## Get started

You need [hugo](http://gohugo.io) installed, on macOS: `brew install hugo`.
You can then watch for changes with `hugo serve -w` or build the site with `hugo`.

The generated site will be in `public/`, along with the Netlify `_headers` and `_redirects` ([more on headers](https://www.netlify.com/docs/headers-and-basic-auth/), [more on redirects](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/)).

Netlify will automatically deploy changes pushed to master, so there is nothing else to do.
