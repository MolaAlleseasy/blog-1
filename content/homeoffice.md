To avoid confusion and manage expectations, here is how I do home office.

## Slack Status

My Slack status emoji will _always_ be one of those:

* 🏡: Working at home
* 🥗: Eating lunch
* 🏋🏻‍♀️: Working out
* 🚂: On the way to/from work
* 🏢: In HQ

## Availability

I will try to write in `#all-team` when I start and end my work day, but you
can probably reach me before and after that as well.
If you need me, just ping me. I will probably not answer immediately, but
in a reasonable amount of time. 
If I'm eating or working out, I will still respond to urgent messages.
If something is burning and I'm not responding, call me.

## Blockers

If I'm blocking you, please talk to me about it and nudge me if you need it.
I will do everything I can to help unblock you.

## Everything else

If you are uncertain or unsatisfied with either my availability, my 
communication or anything else, please just tell me about it. 
I'm sure we can find a solution.
I'm trying the best I can. ✌🏻
