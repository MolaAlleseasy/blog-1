# Three days into Swift
Today is the third day of me learning Swift. I don’t have any prior experience with programming and I don’t know if Swift is a good language to start with. I’ve had some IT course in school but that didn’t help me with anything. It was very theoretical which is not how I’m supposed to learn stuff. At least I already know what _types_ are and how _if-statements_ work. But it’s fun to fiddle around with Swift in a Playground in Xcode. And fun is still the best teacher.

Another reason to learn swift is that I also like iOS and the Apple eco-system. Ever since I started using iOS, which was just in November ’17, I really fell in love with the platform. The speed, the feeling of this unique combination of hardware and software, the beauty of it. And the AppStore of course, which is home to a lot of beautifully crafted apps. 

I want to be a part of this. This desire grew when I started listening to [Under the Radar](https://www.relay.fm/radar) from Relay FM and the [Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm) a few weeks ago. How they talk about building apps, hunting bugs and releasing new features inspired me to create something, to craft something myself. Although I clearly won’t become the next Marco Arment, I at least want to contribute _something_ to the community.

_Something_ will probably be health-related. Another thing I realised is that my Apple Watch I got last fall was a real game-changer for me. I’m not just trying to close my movement, exercise and standing ring every day, I’m just doing it. My Watch helped me to create healthy habits like running, working out and walking a lot every day.

I want to make this more accessible to other people who, like my past-self, are struggling with regular movement and exercise. And I think iOS is a great place to start with.

I also like that [Swift](https://swift.org) _makes it easy to write software that is incredibly fast and safe by design_ and _makes programming simple things easy, and difficult things possible_. Simple, fast and safe. This is what the Internet should be like. I don’t know how Swift compares to other languages but I will hopefully find out along my journey. Join me if you’re interested!

## How I’m learning and what I’ve learned so far
I’m currently doing a [Swift 5 Programming For Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/share/1012RsAEoedVdUR3w=/) course on Udemy to get started. I don’t know if it’s really good but it had the best ratings of all Swift 5 courses and it’s fun because the teacher [Nick Walter](https://twitter.com/nickchuckwalter) is doing a good job so far.

I’m pretty sure that I’ll definitely get the basics right with this course. Stuff like Variables and Constants, Types, Arrays, Functions, Classes and so on. I just completed the lesson about Optionals which was easy but I already came across some more challenging things so far. But one of the first important things to learn is: Google and Stack Overflow are your friends. Just don’t copy and paste everything but try to understand what’s going on. If you don’t understand it, ask.

What’s great about Nick’s course that he has a challenge at the end of each lesson where you go a little bit deeper into the stuff you just learned. This really helps to manifest things.

Another thing I try to use regularly is an App called [m1m0](https://getmimo.com). This is a very lovely, cute app that guiding you through different lessons of a programming language. I already used it before I started attending the course on Udemy but that didn’t feel like making progress. It’s just pushing around given blocks of code. What feels like making a difference to me is actually writing code.

But the combination is great: At first, I complete a lesson on Udemy including a challenge on, let’s say Functions for example. I do this every morning by the way, for a minimum of one hour, before I start working or doing anything else. Throughout the day, whenever I have a few spare minutes, I open m1m0 and work on the same lesson in the app. This repetition really helps with remembering the syntax and how it all comes together.

With that being said, I will now go ahead to start the next lesson: Classes, Structs, Enums and Switches are on the menu for today. I’m excited!
